## Dictionary
- reduction 
  - Stream reduction is an operation that returns one value by combining the elements of a stream. The Java stream API contains a set of predefined reduction operations, such as average() , sum() , min() , max() , and count() .
- mutable reduction operation
  - A mutable reduction operation that accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally transforming the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements have been processed. Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially or in parallel.
  - Examples of mutable reduction operations include: accumulating elements into a Collection; concatenating strings using a StringBuilder; computing summary information about elements such as sum, min, max, or average; computing "pivot table" summaries such as "maximum valued transaction by seller", etc. The class Collectors provides implementations of many common mutable reductions.
- collect() Terminal Operation
  - We can collect the stream elements as List, Map, and Set with the collect() method.
