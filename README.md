## Dictionary
- anonymous class
  - Sometimes we can declare inner class without name such type of inner class are called anonymous class. Java anonymous class is a inner class with no name. https://javabydeveloper.com/java-anonymous-class-with-examples/
    We may use java anonymous classe 3 ways:
    - Anonymous inner class that extends a class.
    - Anonymous inner class that implements an interface.
    - Anonymous inner class that defined as arguments of method / constructor.
- Stream filter(Predicate predicate) - returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. This is an intermediate operation. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stream-filter-java-examples/
- flatMap
  - Stream flatMap(Function mapper) is an intermediate operation.

- mapping() is a static method of the Collectors class that returns a Collector. It converts a Collector accepting elements of one type to a Collector that accepts elements of another type.

- maxBy()  is a static method of the Collectors class that is used to find the maximum element of the input elements using the passed comparator.

- minBy() is a static method of the Collectors class that finds the minimum element of the input elements. It uses the passed comparator to do so.

- optional is a container type for a value which may be absent. It allows developers to represent the empty state.

- reduction 
  - Stream reduction is an operation that returns one value by combining the elements of a stream. The Java stream API contains a set of predefined reduction operations, such as average() , sum() , min() , max() , and count() .

- mutable reduction operation
  - A mutable reduction operation that accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally transforming the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements have been processed. Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially or in parallel.
  - Examples of mutable reduction operations include: accumulating elements into a Collection; concatenating strings using a StringBuilder; computing summary information about elements such as sum, min, max, or average; computing "pivot table" summaries such as "maximum valued transaction by seller", etc. The class Collectors provides implementations of many common mutable reductions.
- collect() Terminal Operation
  - We can collect the stream elements as List, Map, and Set with the collect() method.

  - anyMatch()
  - collect()
  - count()
  - findAny()
  - findFirst()
  - min()
  - max()
  - noneMatch()
  - allMatch()
- functional interface
  - A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. A functional interface can have any number of default methods. Runnable, ActionListener, and Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-interfaces-java/
    - Consumer
    - Predicate
    - Function
    - Supplier
- PREDICATE - Predicate is a functional interface, which accepts an argument and returns a boolean. Usually, it used to apply in a filter for a collection of objects.
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-8-predicate-with-examples/ , https://howtodoinjava.com/java8/how-to-use-predicate-in-java-8/ , https://mkyong.com/java8/java-8-predicate-examples/
  - The Functional Interface PREDICATE is defined in the java.util.function package. It improves manageability of code, helps in unit-testing them separately, and contain some methods like:
    - isEqual(Object targetRef)
    - and(Predicate other)
    - negate()
    - or(Predicate other)
    - test(T t)
